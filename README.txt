# Pro-micro-page-open
A very simple script to open a web page on a linux distro that supports Alt and F2 using an arduino pro micro or arduino leonardo 
in the code you can change the url of the page. By default it will open firefox but you can change it by replacing it with the name of your browser
Note that you should have the arduino AVR-board libraty to use it.
